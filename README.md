# Comet

> Music on ATProto.

Comet's goal is to provide an open, decentralised alternative for uploading and
sharing your music with others.

Or chat along on our Discord: https://discord.gg/ZKK7DnubD9

This project is in the _very_ early stages and a lot will change over time,
especially as this is my first foray into the ATProtocol ecosystem. Stuff will
be a bit messy for a while. Feel free to contribute and voice your opinions!
